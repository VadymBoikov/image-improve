# image-improve

keras code to train neural network to solve following image degradations:
1) remove JPEG artifacts
2) deblur text / images
3) increase resolution of an image



##To run the code:
- Download dataset of good quality images from (scripts not provided, but you can use [div2k](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/), [open-image-dataset](https://github.com/openimages/dataset) ) 
- Use _train.py_ to train network 
- Use _predict.py_ to restore bad images
